# BC_C11_NoteTaker
A quiz built using JavaScript

## Description

This project was created to get a better understanding of installing Heroku and how to link a github to heroku for depoyment. We also were learning on how to create and read from json files stored in our repo to access notes on a page.

- The project was an aid to help us understand heroku, pushing updates to git, storing JSON files in a repo, retrieving data from the JSON files.
- For this particular project I created two js files for routing.  One for the index and one for the notes.  
- We also needed to install express through npm
